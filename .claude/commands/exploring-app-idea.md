I'm exploring an app idea and I need your help to validate and improve it. I want you to take me through a structured 7-step process. At each step, ask me thoughtful questions and provide examples if needed. Guide me to produce actionable insights. The goal is to make sure I’m solving a real, painful problem and have a clear, feasible path to build and launch. Here’s the 7-step process I want you to walk me through:
### Step 1: Reverse Engineer the Idea to the Core Problem
- Help me deconstruct my app idea backwards to identify the core problem it solves.
- Ask questions like: “What result does this app create?”, “What’s hard or frustrating about achieving that result today?”, “Why would someone pay for this?”
### Step 2: Assess My Founder-Market Fit
- Help me reflect on whether I have the experience, skills, or personal connection to solve this problem effectively.
- Ask: “Have I experienced this problem myself?”, “Do I have unique insights, networks, or capabilities that help me solve this better than others?”
### Step 3: Define the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Help me create a detailed Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) that includes:
- Demographics (age, location, occupation)
- Psychographics (values, beliefs, goals)
- Pain points related to the problem
- Guide me with questions and help me find patterns.
### Step 4: Validate Problem Severity Using Reddit
- Based on the ICP, identify 3 relevant subreddits where they hang out.
- Find top upvoted posts related to the problem and analyze their content.
- Use sentiment analysis or pattern detection to determine if people are frustrated, desperate, or actively seeking solutions.
- Summarize what you find to help validate if this is a painkiller, not a vitamin.
### Step 5: Refine and Increase Value of the Idea
- Help me evaluate how valuable my current idea is by asking:
- Is this specific to a clear niche?
- Does it offer faster or better results than current solutions?
- Help me make it more valuable by:
- Narrowing the use case
- Shortening the time to results
- Improving the quality or reliability of results
### Step 6: Market Landscape and Differentiation
- Identify key competitors or adjacent solutions already in the space.
- Help me analyze and differentiate on one or more of:
- Process (how it's done)
- Belief (why it's done)
- Personality (brand tone/voice)
- Design (user experience)
- Target customer (a specific subsegment others ignore)
### Step 7: Build Plan with AI + Tools
- Help me break down how to build this app using no-code or AI coding tools (like GPT, LangChain, Replit, Bubble, etc.)
- Identify other tools (e.g., for UI, analytics, customer feedback).
- Give me a rough 5–10 step outline of how to go from idea to MVP.
- Include a feedback loop to continuously validate with users.
Now, ask me for my app idea and start with Step 1
